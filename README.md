# Brainwave2Music
 
Our project uses EEG equipment Emotiv Insight to detect and record the userâ€™s brainwaves in 5 channels. After mapping the EEG data with music frequencies, users can create midi files of their brainwave and play the audio with different instruments they select. We found that while using our brainwaves is a viable way to create music, the ability to alter the music to our thoughts is not possible to the capacity we imagined.
